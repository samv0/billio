# Getting Started with Billio

Hi, this project is currently deployed and available to use at https://bill.samvinh.com

I often want to estimate bills at restaurant while I am selecting menu items to make sure
I am staying within an acceptable budget range. This estimation, of course, does not only
apply to restaurants but just about any time you need to calculate any bill including discounts,
tax, and tip. You can also split the total any number of ways >= 1. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
